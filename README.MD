## FAQ
Q1. When I run the program nothing happens, and no info.md, what do I do?

```
Answer: So I haven't added where if it doesn't detect info.md it will create a new one, so for now just make a new file and name it info.md
```

Q2. After running the program, why is there nothing in info.md?

```aiignore
Answer: There is two likely problems, 1. your miss spelled info.md, 2. your system isn't compatible with the command below:
```
Command: ``systeminfo``
